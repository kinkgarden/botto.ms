# About the DBA
## History
At the very end of 2019, our founder Harke made a group chat: the Douching Bottoms Support Group.
On January 3, 2020, Monokai created the first piece of union propaganda using the name Douching Bottoms Association.
On March 26, 2020, cactus was like "hey should we make a website," and Harke suggested the domain `botto.ms`.
